# SuperstoreSales

In this project we analyse the data from 9994 sales from a super store in the USA.

On the first graph we get to see the 10 most recurring clients.

On the second graph however we get to see the 10 clients that spent the most money in the store and surprisingly we do not see any clients from the first list, even though they are the ones the go to the store the most.

Now on the third and last graph we can see the monthly revenue, just by looking quickly at it we can see that the month they have the lowest sale rate is february and the highest is november.
